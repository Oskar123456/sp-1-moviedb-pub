His mother is French. His American father was in the US Air Force and served in the Second World War. Jean-Marc Barr is primarily known as an actor, but is also a film director, screenwriter and producer. Barr is bilingual in French and English: he speaks French with a nasal, hybrid accent, reminiscent of his American upbringing - with a slight American accent and occasional anglicisms in interviews - and English with a Mid-Atlantic accent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +|            |            |        |                                                                        |            |                      |                             |                                                                               |            |

As a kid she focused on playing outside in the woods and playing classical piano.  In college she majored in art, focusing on painting and making puppets.

She has acted in a variety of films, from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action films. Following her appearances on the December 1985 and May 1986 covers of British Vogue, Thurman's breakthrough role was Dangerous Liaisons (1988) in which she starred.

In 1989 he graduates from the Bulgarian Acting Academy, where his mentor is Encho Halachev, and leaves for Sweden. In Swedish movies he often portrays Eastern-European characters, many of them antagonistic, or, as he himself states, "all bad guys who eventually die". His most wide success is the portrayal of Alexander Zalachenko, a former Soviet spy, in the Swedish film trilogy "Millenium", based on the books by Stieg Larsson.

Only in 1975 after "Sommergaeste (1975)" he could show his talent as a reflexive actor with tendencies towards introspection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1941-03-22 | 2019-02-16 |      2 |                                                                        | nm0004486  | Acting               | Bruno Ganz                  | Zürich, Switzerland                                                           |      5.109 | /siuPo91XYmYLXeCdq2DZTyNtpYq.jpg

Since 2016, he's been a part of more than a dozen productions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            |            |      2 | http://www.olanormelli.com/                                            |            | Acting               | Ola Normelli                |                                                                               |      0.001 |

He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning "Cannonball") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +|            |            |        |                                                                        |            |                      |                             |                                                                               |            |

Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |            |            |        |                                                                        |            |                      |                             |                                                                               |            |

She started working in the pharmaceutical research field before moving to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career in comedy.Retta started performing stand-up comedy in 1996, although she said she did not start "earning money" until 1998, when she started touring on the college circuit. Retta said she used to get "really nauseated" before a performance, but that the feeling passed with experience.Retta has said her stand-up material tends to be slightly embellished stories from her regular everyday life, family, and friends. She has also made jokes about her obesity. Retta has stated she would give up stand-up comedy for a full-time acting career if possible: "I'm not married to stand-up, just because it's a road thing. It's very lonely with all the traveling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |            |            |        |                                                                        |            |                      |                             |                                                                               |            |

He started as a member of the Los Angeles comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former Saturday Night Live repertory players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers. It was there he met Chris Kattan and the two became good friends and both went on to Saturday Night Live later. He has also appeared on several television programs, including Strangers with Candy, Grace Under Fire and Living Single during his time at The Groundlings.

He was declared quite possibly the worst cast member ever during his first season. However, his talents of impersonations and range of characters shot him forward to making him arguably the greatest Saturday Night Live cast member ever. During his seven year run he is one of the few cast members to ever be nominated for an Emmy for a performance and played George W. Bush during the 2000 elections. He's appeared in every Saturday Night Live movie since his premiere on the show in 1995. In 2002 he left  Saturday Night Live and was the only cast member to ever receive a farewell from all the current cast members at the end of the season finale show. Since leaving the show Will has pursued a career in films.

Gallo is known for his outspoken views and generally sarcastic nature, once stating: "I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings; and I did it out of spite." Gallo was awarded the Coppa Volpi for Best Actor at the 67th Venice International Film Festival for his performance as a wordless escaping Muslim prisoner in Jerzy Skolimowski's Essential Killing. His own feature film Promises Written In Water, which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in, also screened In Competition at the festival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |            |            |        |                                                                        |            |                      |                             |                                                                               |            |
